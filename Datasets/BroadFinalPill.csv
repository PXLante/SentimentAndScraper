"I always think it’s funny how the “logical gender” can fuck up logic so easily and without restraint. Just because a dog tends to offer loyalty (although I’ve had dogs that don’t give a fuck about me unless I’m feeding or petting them), doesn’t mean a human who is loyal is being treated like a dog. Someone making a choice to remain loyal, and the recipient of that loyalty appreciating it, is not the same as someone who is being coerced into an unfair, unequal relationship. 

Also, I spent last night scrubbing my dog’s diarrhea off the carpet, so I’m not really sure I have all that much power in this relationship ... ",1

"Cultural factors are at play.

I lived in Asia for a good long while. I'm always entertained when I see manosphere types write about how wonderfully submissive Asian women are. I've also seen many arrive in Asia with the idea that access to Asian women will solve all of their problems with women. Allow me to tell you how I saw things play out:

Asian woman and western man meet.

Western man is very persistent.

In Asian woman's culture, this is indicative of love and commitment.

In White guy's culture, this is indicative of his desire to get laid.

Sexual relations begin. 

Western man eventually decides to head to new pastures.

Asian woman takes this as an affront to her self-worth and dignity.

Western man is like, stop being so clingy.

Asian woman commences to make his life miserable, calling or standing outside his workplace yelling for justice, squatting in his apartment refusing to leave, calling upon gangster relatives to rough him up a bit...

I have witnessed all of these things.

Alternatively, the two decide to get married or a mysterious pregnancy occurs and they are pushed into deeper territory. If they're unmarried when she gives birth, his name will not be on the birth certificate and he has zero parental rights.

But if they get married, Asian woman often becomes frustrated because western dude is not playing the roles she expects him to play in the relationship. And yes, she does expect to control all of the money. That is her culture. I can't pretend to understand all of the cultural expectations at play but I have witnessed catastrophic divorces. Divorces where he lost everything because he was on her territory and she had the support of the legal system and her family and the property was in her name. I knew a couple where the woman ran into oncoming traffic with her baby in her arms to make a point in an argument. Crazy shit from desperate people.

I do know one couple who appear to have a healthy relationship. That's one of around 50 Asian woman-actually-born-and-raised-in-Asia/Western man relationships between people I actually know fairly well. Relationships are hard enough when you're both of the same culture. Throw that cultural stuff in and whoa boy! 

Anyway to bring this back to a response to your troll: All types of personalities are probably represented in more or less steady ratios in all countries/environments. But culture plays a really strong role in mediating the way those personalities manifest. If you've lived your whole life in America or a similar melting pot, it's hard to see that clearly, because race =/= culture in America. People who were born in America all share a similar culture, regardless of race. My ideas changed a lot with experience in other countries. People are people everywhere, and everyone has desires, ambitions and needs of their own, and those will ALWAYS manifest eventually in a relationship. How they manifest often depends on culture, and in Asia, western dudes are out of their depth.

"It's definitely not coercion. Coercion is making someone do something under duress, by (other than physical) force or through a threat.

I disagree that there's some distinction between the law and what it should be considered. Laws need to reflect our ideas of right and wrong. If we believe that lying about birth control should be a crime on par with rape, then the law needs to reflect that belief. Hopefully we as a society can come to some rough consensus and then get our laws updated. It probably won't happen right now, but we can get it started.

The conditions of the consent being false doesn't mean there was no consent, only that it was gained falsely. I don't know if I've made this comparison in this thread, but there's a reason robbing someone with a gun is a far more serious crime than convincing them to give you money by lying, i.e. a scam or con.

I think the best analog would be fraud: criminal deception with the intent to gain personal benefit.

I don't think a crime should be considered rape unless it includes ""forcible compulsion,"" incapacitation of the victim, or the abuse of a position of trust or authority. Lying about birth control doesn't include any of those.

Of course there's also statutory rape, in which we declare a person incapable of giving consent because of their age. But that's still a question of giving consent, and if you obtain consent (even fraudulently) then it doesn't qualify.

So I would call it something like ""sexual assault via fraud,"" even though that's a tremendously awkward phrase. But at least it accurately describes what's happening.",1

"Regarding the article they linked... First off, they treat the myth of the Amazons as reality. In reality Amazons did exist, but if they could at least read a wikipedia article on them, they'd see that, according to Herodotus, they were ""frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men"". ""No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle"". 
So yes, they did kill men in battles, but obviously not their husbands. They are not a model for a society of women that discards men. The legend created around them may be a model for it - but you can't treat a legend as reality.

Also the guy who wrote the article talks about reproduction of a bunch of animals and even some plants, and then says: 

> Males do not give birth. Anywhere. Period.

The seahorse males give birth. Not that it changes anything for humans, but if you're gonna go so far to even talk about reproduction of dandelions, you shouldn't make this mistake. It's not a big mistake, the article could have had the same point had he wrote ""with the exception of seahorse males"" - but this way it's just factually incorrect. 

> The female has a virtual 100% monopoly on reproduction in most of nature, not the male. ""Patriarchy"" is an attempt to equalize the reproductive process between males and females. It is an attempt to take those useless males and make them productive by attaching them to the reproductive process, of which they are normally rejected from. In fact, in all of nature, the only species which tries to equalize the reproduction of the male and female is the human species.  

Terpers need to make a deal with themselves, is it natural for men to dominate women, or is it not? It's very cute how human attempt to change nature seems noble and justified if, according to a certain hypothesis, it favors men. But if, according to a different hypothesis (that claims it's natural for men to rule over women), the attempt to change nature is unfavorable for male dominance of women, terpers will immediately call it unnatural and even degenerate.

 If something happens in your relationship, you look at what caused it and compare it to what the books tell you may be the reason, then  you may look at what redpillers tell you, and eventually, through that, you can piece together certain conclusions to the way females act in certain situations, 


and if it happens again,
 then again, 
then 1000s of other guys have the exact situations and behaviors that they see in girls and post their conclusions and reasoning's
they share that, and through that process, you become a little more solid in your understanding in the way females act.


 Still it's not set in stone, but its fair to say its more of fact at that point. Because the contrary rarely happens. Sure that could be due to delusions and us looking for negative explanations for behaviours, and many redpillers will confidently try justify her behaviours.

While men are entirely their own individuals, rational and extremely diverse, women sometimes can't help themselves but react in similar, predictable, emotional/gullible/naive ways that can be taken advantage of by a strong male mind.

They're essentially implying that women's brains are hardwired in certain ways that allow a rational man who knows all the tricks and rules of the game (= the PUA and his pupils) to outplay, outsmart and outmaneuver them in the game of flirting, romantic relationships and sex.

That's a pretty damn dangerous idea since it teaches PUA audiences that all women, even educated and 'smart' ones, are inherently less intelligent and autonomus than strong, clever, rational alpha men due to their 'female' traits that supposedly force them to respond in predictable, often emotional and irrational ways.

>I disagree that a man needs “experience” to be able to be good in bed. Sex, just like any other skill, can be taught by one tutor just as well, probably even better, as by multiple tutors.

How would you know what you want in bed if you haven't had sex yet? Porn makes everything look fun until you finally do it. You're basically taking a wild guess of what you might like and getting into a relationship with someone who you assume will teach you things that will make you a better lover. Again life is not such a rosey ideal.

Sad truth of reality for you. Women usually don't like to teach men how to please a woman. It can be fun in some cases but not if they are having casual sex with someone they imagined they wouldn't see again. These so called tutors you say will likely to be willing to go to bed with a guy who doesn't know what he's doing because what women goes to bed with a guy that makes her feel awkward doing sex?

I largely agree with you and I actually enjoyed reading this lengthy bu humorous question. I think the problem nowadays is that there are just too many pretentious 21-year old dudes who think they've figured it all out when in reality they don't know shit about life. They have some sort of ridiculously romanticized Hollywood-idea of patriarchy, where the man is a kind of pasha and gets to hold his girlfriend as a sex slave. Literally the *only* time and situation where this was actually the case in the west was if you were a slave owner in antebellum America and you had fun raping your 15-year old slave girls. But even that was more problematic than some guys might fantasize it to have been because if you got caught by a fellow white person, you were probably ousted from your social community for the rest of your life.

>We've seen population studies and genetic studies and MRIs and links between the desire for young, attractive, fertile women. I'm not disputing any of that. What I'm disputing is the claim that VIRGIN preference is in our genes. Nothing anywhere scientific says that.

Let's move away from a binary (virginity vs. non-virginity) approach and interpret it as a scale (with N=0 women on the end and N=∞ women on the other. Or N=100+, if you prefer a more realistic number). *All other observable qualities (looks, intelligence, fertility, age etc.) being equal*, where do you think would male preferences fall? And might that have something to do with what TGP said?

Because he's just applying basic logic there. Men want to procreate, and if they're expected to invest into the kids of a woman they're sleeping with, they want guaranteed paternity. The more a woman fucks around, the more questionable paternity is. Males who cared about that passed on their genes, males who didn't... did not, or were less likely to do so. Play that game long enough (a few thousand generations) and you get males who care about women fucking nobody but them. Aka virgins.

The only reason hypergamy doesn't apply to men is that for most men its not an option.

Just wanting an attractive partner isnt hypergamy. even if I interpret your odd phrasing of ""obtain attractive object-women"" as ""wants to date someone more attractive than they themselves are""

Wanting something is not the same as being capable of acting on it. hypergamy in this context isn't about what women *want*

Why wouldn't a woman want the best however she defines that. Just happens her idea of best probably isn't a pizza delivery guy that looks like Kevin James and lives with his mother.

In a world where everyone is seeking the best they can do, more options = better results

Arguing against hypergamy requires a strawman imo.

The problem is when people misinterpret it or overstate the effect. If you find a woman that is a 2, shes going to have more options than a man that is a 2. If she has 2 guys who want a FWB and the guy has 0 options for any kind of interaction, it might not seem better to her, so she is going to strongly reject hypergamy because she feels like she got a raw deal because she keeps hearing about how women have it so good.

I've seen women on forever alone complain about being so ugly that they are invisible to men, looked at post history and shes had a pregnancy scare, currently has an std, is worried about the potential for aids, she had one older guy interested in her that she rejected.

The point? even self described ugly women have it better, they just dont feel like they do.

I read the other thread as well, methodology / controlling for other factors was absent in the article so My thoughts ran similar to yours.

I didnt see anything indicating how they instructed people to rate themselves . It appears some instruction was provided, but the paper is pretty vague.

The study is absent the words wealth, status, wealth, salary etc.

without *why* men overrate its incomplete, you cant rate attractiveness and exclude status, it doesn't work that way with how sensitive women are to status.

If I had a 6 figure job I'd rate myself significantly higher! a woman that doesn't know that? yeah,both could arrive at completely different results.

That doesn't men have an overinflated sense of themselves, just that the study was flawed.

They need to control for / manipulate a lot of factors for the study to be worth anything.

How do you show women pictures of men. were they all dressed in the same uniform lol?

That men overate themselves may be true, but I don't see that paper as convincing.Its a classic in a vacuum joke.

No. That was an aside to my main question, which was ""Is anything he's saying incorrect ?"" 

Rather than chosing to answer the hard part, you chose to go all in on the ""shaming"" thing. Fine. You wanted to be sarcastic about that, you got some sarcasm in return.

But this wasn't motivated about any of my feelings about shamey stuff. I was interested in whether you thought anything he said was wrong, and what you'd offer up as reasons to believe the alternative.

Seemed like, exactly as you're doing here, you'd rather be outraged and make those kind of snarky comments than address his point.

Are you seriously trying to tell me you wern't doing that ? If he answered ""Actually, yes. I am originally from Indonesia"" how would that have made any difference to the truth (or not) of what he said ?

>No vitrol, just interesting so I guess I just need to be more aware of who gets tagged with that little admonishment and when and by who, all on me. Good observational experience which is what I base all of my perceptions on.

Don't pretend that you were genuinely interested in his country of origin and that was pertinent to whether what he said was true. 

What he said is, so far as I understand history, true. True here in the UK. True in the US. True in Indonesia. True in HG tribes. True in agricultural communities. True everywhere until the advent of the modern industrial state.

You don't want to talk about that, and why that was the case.

You initially tried to avoid it by snarkily asking his country of origin. Now you're avoiding it by having this pointless exchange with me about me calling you out on it.

This is all immaterial to the main point here.

Is what he said true ? 

If it is, what would you like to offer as reasons why unisex spaces are ""better"" in some sense ? At least enough reasons to balance out the drawbacks he proposed and to, preferably, make it a positive sum choice to make the switch.

Well, fine. Everyone uses copies that I've ever read, but I guess we can say duplication if you like. They're still whole long chunks of genome, each of which has many genes, that are taken roughly 50:50 from each parent. Each gene in each parent has a 50% chance of being duplicated into a true genetic child. And that also means 25% of the genes will be in any true genetic neice, or grandchild.

>They literally say what I said on the pages I linked you to.

What they say has nothing whatsoever to do with this debate. Two of the articles are to do with *other species*. The evolution discussed here could easily have taken place in the time after we split, and even the admixture in has had hundreds of generations to evolve against the Homo Sapien background.

The third was basically confirming all the groundwork for the theory I'm describing. 

Yeah, *we knew humans are not monogamous* because that is a *precondition for this theory being true*.

Look, I'm sure I can't just throw random anthropology articles at you on barely related subjects and get any other reaction that ""whats this? This isn't related."" or ""but this exactly confirms what I was just saying""

Thats what those articles read like to me. 

>But she’s not a desirable marriage partner to males either

Being not desirable (according to our genetic preference) is not being a bad wife!

It's being a bad copying machine for your genes. Thats their concern. They *try to make it your concern* with instincts like the one I am describing.

That affects guys decisions, I'm sure. Having an affair certainly affects your value as a wife *because* of the instincts programmed by this.

But human beings (not genes) score bad wives differently than genes do too. The genes don't care *if meatbag has a good time* while he's doing his copying job.

*The meatbags* (thats us BTW!) have their own things they want as well. They want a nice person. They want to get on. They want to have good sex. They want to enjoy their lives *as well as* wanting kids. 

The genes objective is just *kids, kids, kids, grandkids, grandkids, duplication, duplication.*.

Having 150 living children is a ""dream wife"" for a gene. Having 150 children *is not a dream life for a man or a woman*^*

"> Because the resulting instinctive feeling is calibrated to hundreds of thousands of years of ""genetic experience"" of the evolutionary environment.

How could we know it's evolutionary instead of cultural?

Your explanation makes senses, but other explanations also make sense.  Like, Bonobo monkeys are also closely related to humans but have a much more promiscuous society. They do not observe monogamy, have sex freely, and raise their babies communally.  Their society is matriarchal. Although any individual male might not benefit genetically from this system, his tribe is more successful and reproduces more, passing on it's collective genetic lineage. I.e. it ensures that monkeys similar to him will pass on their genes. In favor of the idea that Bonobos provide insight into human behavior, bonobos are one of the only species other than humans that engage in sex for pleasure, outside of the times that females are fertile.  If your theories about early human evolution are accurate, then sure, the ick is genetic, but if you're wrong about the dawn of time, then you are also wrong about what's causing the ick factor, and it may be cultural.

It could be a mix - chimps are more aggressive and monogamous because their habitats have significant resource scarcity.  Bonobos are more peaceful and open partly because resources are plentiful where they live. Maybe we were super slutty prior to the ice age and then things became a little more every man for himself.  But that still pegs monogamy as a relatively recent development, in evolutionary time.  And given that we're in a time of resource plenty, the current emphasis on monogamy isn't necessarily reasonable, from an evolutionary perspective.",1

"Are you illiterate? He said that women bring their womb as their sole contribution to the marriage- never mind that both partners in most couples work now, and that women bring much, much more than that anyway- and that the marriage contracts either guarantees the right to it or is worthless. Translation: ""If you are married and you say no to your husband at any time, you have broken your vows and are worthless as a wife"". I don't remember ""have sex any time he wants"" in my wedding vows; in my situation, I'm the higher-libido partner so it really doesn't apply, but neither of us is obligated by marriage to offer our bodies when we don't feel like it. 

Arguing that spousal rape isn't rape because of marriage vows is asinine and absolutely does advocate rape. Getting married does not negate the bodily autonomy of either partner, and that bodily autonomy does not make marriage worthless. By contrast, I say it makes the marriages that last stronger, because the people who are in them actually want to be there, rather than the days when women had nowhere to go and had to stay in miserable marriages, getting raped by their husbands and being treated barely above a servant because there weren't many good jobs for women and divorced women were seen as shameful and undesirable.

If you truly were anti-abortion, you’d want universal healthcare, subsidized education through college, and subsidized food, housing, and clothing, not to mention abundant birth control and comprehensive sex ed; you’d want to make the best situation possible for all mothers, because you’d realize someone women will get pregnant no matter what, and they and their children would need help to live somewhat comfortably.

> If you don’t want those things, and you’re anti-abortion, you just want to make willful women who chose to have sex “suffer the consequences.” You don’t care about them or their kids, only making them pay for “what they did.”

Exactly.  The anti-choice death cult doesn't WANT to prevent abortions, they don't give a flying fuck about life or babies, they never have and they never will.  The sole reason they pretend to care about fetuses is to use them as an excuse to abuse women, nothing more.  They're not ""pro-life"", they're fetus-fetishists, their only interest in fetuses is as props in their sick fantasies of controlling women.

"The part of that argument that bugs me here in the US, is that (as I understand it) women in our service are limited in the roles they can serve.  I’ve read multiple comments from servicewomen who enlisted believing they would being doing the same tasks as men only to find out they aren’t allowed to.  (Again, as I understand it) Women are essentially barred from the like most dangerous front line type roles.  Those are also higher paying roles.  There was even one women who commented that she drives supplies around, so she’s out on battlefields, driving around, relatively exposed, but she gets paid less than male counterparts despite basically having similar exposure to risk.  The argument used over here tends to be that men have riskier jobs and women get coddled even in the military - except that everyone passes the same basic training, and crucially most women who enlist expected to carry equal weight only to be told they weren’t allowed to do so.

So the whole “woe is us, men are expendable” argument always falls flat to me because when women try to step up and even the burden *men* actively work to prevent it, but then try to turn around and use it as evidence that women have it so easy.

If I’m carrying a bunch of boxes and complaining how it’s so heavy, and someone offers to help carry some, I don’t get to refuse their help/tell them they aren’t allowed to help, but then still continue bemoaning how heavy the load is and how unfair it is that no one will help me.",-1

"He mentioned that his marriage was cold and loveless since the beginning. It seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me. It seems, from the video, that he started out thinking that all women suck and when his wife showed some red flags, he decided that it's just female nature and not a personally trait that makes them incompatible in the long term. 

It's a pattern that I see with many MGTOWs. They decide that all women are alike, so  they stop vetting women they associate with, and as a result they end up with women who are either not compatible with them or are outright bad people. I almost feel sorry for them, at times.",-1

It was less the lack of sex and more about how women were treated by society, they believed women were treated unfairly better than men. I left because I saw a comic about a girl meeting a boy and messing up a lot of his stuff. He went off to war and she stayed loyal to him even after he died. I felt a connection to that, a sense of loyalty that comic portrayed, and it was beautiful to me. I was told that it was bad because the girl basically was an asshole for pretending to like other people and wrecking his car. What I felt was beautiful was the  perseverance it showed.

"I don't date single parents because I don't want to raise *any* child.  But weirdly, that's not the fault of single parents.  They're free to date and try to find partners, and I'm free to... not be their type.

It's not really the preference itself that's bothering people.  I've never been criticized here for not wanting to be involved with single parents, because I'm not *mad* at them for being not what I want.  These people are basically just making fun of a woman's appearance and possible life situation because she posted a photo of herself wearing a sweatshirt with a ""funny"" slogan on it.  It's shitty of them.

The difference for people tends to be how much blame you place on the outside party for not meeting your preferences.  If I'm like, ""eh, I only date people with black hair"", then people might find me silly or shallow, but I'll likely get a lot less hate.  If I say, ""I would never date a blonde or a brunette or a redhead: who would *want* that in a partner?"" or act like their hair color makes them beneath my preferences, then people get more angry.  These commenters aren't like, ""I don't want to date a single mom"", they're more in the vein of ""How dare she think anyone wants her?"".",-1

"Are you sure about that? The most fool proof method of getting laid is by being physically attractive or being a talented popular artist (not like a painter but a hip hop singer). Money too but tbh if your really really ugly even that could be a gamble. That's essentially what the blackpill is. Physical attraction > talented artists/entertainers > rich and then other things factor in like personality. But at the forefront is physical attraction. I always laugh when people say really ugly guys can get girls by funny. Do those ugly funny guys like crack jokes mid sex or something ? I don't think there's even been a correlation between jokes and sexual arousal. Usually it goes hand in hand with physical attraction. You need to cross a minimum level of threshold of attractiveness before being funny factors in. If you dont you're out of luck. 

Physical attraction defiantly plays less of a role when you become older though... but I think most guys want girls when they are younger too. ",-1

As a question how would you react if you were in a similar situation and you realized the dude had to take a viagra or something to get hard? Or his mind's wandering and he cant stay hard. 

I mean everybody's aroused by being wanted. Most people when they are having sex care about getting their partner off to some degree especially in a relationship, it's about being good at it and having them feel nice. 

It sounds misogynistic to say but women do say they sometimes have ""duty sex"" where they arent fully into it or are doing it to keep their partner happy as this guy would be, but in that case you have lube and shit, a dude cant really just create a substitute like that. 

I do think he's in the wrong in a way, she even asked him to just give her head, which it's like, man whatever. Shes frustrated, try to get her off; his story made it seem more like she just wanted some attention from him and was maybe thinking offers of sex would be foolproof.

I cant see a woman being still turned on enough to be into it or want it when she had to goad her boyfriend into sex with her.

women also treat men as bad as the men will let them. if you act like a nice submissive beta towards women, they will take advantage of that and treat you like an orbiter. they will *expect* to receive attention and validation and support (emotional, financial, and personal favors) from guys like that 


>Despite being sexually attracted to a man, and him making moves on you, you must reject his advances lest you become a dumb slut in his eyes.


this is a dumb idea. it's not going to make men see you any differently, it will just select for the most persistent men. the thirsty/desperate men who don't have a lot of other options may continue to make advances toward you after getting rejected. 


but the men who have other options (the high value ones) aren't going to waste more of their time and effort chasing you, they'll just move on to some other girl. and eventually they'll find one who isn't playing this stupid game and she will win the prize.


for me personally, if i get rejected, that's it. there are literally billions of other women on the planet. if i get a ""NO"" i'm not going to waste energy trying to turn it into a ""YES"" when i could better use that energy finding a different girl who says ""YES"" from the start.


if you don't want men to see you as a dumb slut, then don't play this game. all it's doing is making men think you are a woman says no at first but then eventually puts out if you keep pushing, ie a dumb slut. what you need to do is up your standards. stop playing stupid games but also don't just say yes to every random guy who is sexually attractive to you. say yes to the guys who are sexually attracted but also high value in other ways and seem like they want the same thing that you want. and have solid boundaries and stick to them. if you want a serious relationship but a guy wants to keep it casual, then end it.

"Men and women see beauty differently in the other sex than you'd expect by just mirroring female preferences onto men.

Men have an extreme orientation towards looks that signal fertility and youth. Much more so than women, who have a weak orientation to men *modestly older than them*.

You're looking at other women through eyes that *prefer markers of attractiveness keyed a few years older then you are*.

Men look at women through eyes that *prefer markers of attractiveness that signal 18-24 years old*.

Women over 30 start to have real difficulties looking like they're 24 years old. Mens perceptions of beauty are very keyed to the differences that herald the forthcoming *major differences* that come 40+. Who really can't look 24 years old anymore, or even 30.

RP guys take it too far. As generally a bunch of assholes would. Because we're basically assholes. So thats why they slag them off.

* ""Sex is neither necessary nor sufficient for self-examination and growth."" - I think we are talking about different things. What Im saying is sex is necessary to discover your sexual side and sexual compatibility and what you look for in that area. I think what you are arguing is overall growth, which of course yea, sex is neither sufficient nor necessary.

* ""women orgasm more in commited relationships"" - Im not arguing every girl should be a cheating slut who has one night stands, Im arguing its advantageous in this day and age to what you feel like is best for you. If she is having great sex with a regular partner, obviously she is not going to go chase crappy fuckboys. But Im arguing in a scenario where she didnt have a boyfriend, she shouldnt be ashamed of having good casual sex with a non-commited fwb. 

* ""more unsatisfying casual sexual encounters will discourage more sex"" - you are absolutely right. But thats assuming it will always be unsatisfying. Im arguing its advantageous for a girl to not be ashamed of having frequent sex with multiple men (aka slutty) if she enjoys it or it benefits her somehow. Also NoFap does deal with women as well contrary to popular belief, and the mechanism of thought affecting behaviour affecting thought is gender independent. Again I respect your anecdotal evidence, and raise you mine: I have a lot of female friends and a lot of them **definitely enjoy** their casual sexual relationships.

"On the contrary, it has been my experience that the narrative of women having *lower* sex drives than men is the one which better serves the hypergamous feminine imperative by helping placate the men from whom women are extracting non-sexual utility while they simultaneously obtain *prodigous* amounts of sexual utility from the few men to whom they are actually sexually attracted.

Understand that there are far more men who get sex because their wives/girlfriends/ONSes got turned down by their preferred option then women who get sex for the same reason.  Also understand that for every sexually unfulfilled man who is seeking a sexual encounter right now, there is a woman offering sex to a man who already has at least one other offer in his inbox, and probably more. One man will go without sex and the other will have sex with two women tonight simply because he wants to keep his options open.

"""How to attract men""

&#x200B;

Assuming you take care of your appearance and you're not really fat, just be friendly with men.

&#x200B;

I speak as a man myself, but most women come across as aloof and in a bad mood. You set yourself apart from almost every woman by simply being friendly - smiling, flirting, having a twinkle in your eye, open body language.

&#x200B;

Then you distinguish yourself even more by doing nice things for him - cooking meals, giving him gifts, spontaneous sex, showing appreciation for him.

&#x200B;

Seriously, it's not difficult. Most women take care of their appearance and are decent looking. So it's your behaviour that separates you from other women and attracts men.",-1

this is 100% true.

"Obviously not. 

If a woman did something sexual in the past and it didn't work for her - it was uncomfortable, even painful, or she just didn't enjoy it and it did nothing for her from an arousal or pleasure standpoint - she shouldn't do that with you any more than she ought to do anything else she doesn't want to do.

The resentment issue comes up when she's done other stuff in the past - often with casual partners, sometimes the same night she met them - but she doesn't want to do things like that with you because ""We don't have that kind of relationship"" or ""I don't want you to see me like that"".

When your woman goes out to have some fun with a casual guy and she brings her fun side, her sexy side, her dirty slutty side, and is forward, fun, flirty, dirty, and sexual with him - then when she comes out to meet you, she brings her prim and proper relationship side, she's metaphorically slapping you in the face. Those other guys got her fun, spontaneous, forward, flirty, dirty, fuck a guy the day you meet him just for fun side. You get to wine and dine her and make her feel special to earn her routine sex side.

In summary, ""I tried out anal in college and it hurt like hell and did nothing for me and I don't want to try it again"" is fine.

But ""Look - I was in a different place a few months before we met when I was meeting guys for a quick hook-up in their cars on my lunch break from work. I'm not that girl any more, and we don't have that kind of relationship. I don't want to have that kind of sex with you"" is a slap in the face.",-1

also the college community is less insular here because its all very ""the city is your campus"" sooo the college hook up scene bleeds into the early/mid 20s hook up scene which again i acknolwedge is not the same in non big city environments, but its also were a lot of highly educated people end up relocating to. most everyone gets a fake ID freshman year so basically everyone 18 - 26 is parting and hooking up with each other",-1

And so the ones that do, really pique his interest and attract him more.

"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch. I’ll have you know my name is John, and I woke up this morning 5:30 sharp to the smell of wet pussy. I was getting a blowjob from two bitches (Shit was SO Cash), one was trying to fit my humongous 3 pound balls in her mouth while the other was choking halfway on my 18 and 3\8 inch dick. She started to squirt hard, she was convulsing and having 6 orgasms at the same time. I gave it to them and they were on the floor squirting like motherfucking fountains. Must have come about a quart of sperm and compressed air. Imagine your best orgasm, then multiply it by 35. I had to go to base camp so I front-flipped from my 14th floor barracks into my valet parked 2012 Ferrari (I got connexions). Pushed my shit to about 4 hundo (mph, mind you) and I was at base camp in no time. When I entered, I became a top sniper and was granted access to the entire arsenal of the USMC. I learned how to kill someone in over 700 different ways and was assigned to be the leader of a squad that will kill 300 terrorists using gorilla warfare tactics. Also did 6000 push-ups, 8000 sit-ups and bench-pressed 30 plates in 16 minutes. After basic training, I met a network of secret spies who will help me trace your IP address, while eating gold plated sushi and 15,000 $ champagne. My unit got the rest of the day off and I became captain of our base’s football team and starter of the basketball team. I got straight A’s on the military entrance exams and received more awards. Meanwhile, you were jacking off to pictures on Facebook and naked drawn Japanese people. Went back in the Lambo to my barracks and now I am getting ready to go to sleep. I am going to graduate at the top of my class in the Navy Seals tomorrow and I want to look pretty much perfect for it. Don’t be a stranger and remember, I did more in one day than you will your entire life.",-1

"Great question.  First, you are gonna need to fuck a lot of bitches.  That goes without saying of course.  They have to be 10/10's too.  No bullshit 8 chuds!


Next you need to understand how women work.  Their inner workings.  Their need to be subservient to us top dogs.    

Now, you already mentioned the fedora, so you are more far along than others, but I will also suggest some nice wingtips and some suspenders.  BITCHES LOVE THAT SHIT!!

Now you have come to the secret part.   What is that secret?  EYE CONTACT!  Practice intensely staring into your own eyes in the mirror.   Try to look as intimidating as you can.  Bitches eat that sht up.   When you can achieve an erection from staring into your own eyes, you are ready.

Take this skill to the mall food court.  Eye fuck every female you see... HARD.  Soon they will not be able to resist.  Fuck all these bitches.

Then, and only then are you ready to become an alpha mod.  Just make sure not to let no beta or woman interfere with your greatness.

"Let me enlighten you, fellow dudebro.

The Matrix is, on its surface, a pretty superficial movie. You have Keanu Reeves, who plays a braindead everyman. He might be a programmer hacker, but he's not very smart. Hell, all he does is say ""Whoa"" to everything and look confused.

This is actually a metaphor for our own awareness. As aware as the average beta thinks he is, he's actually completely clueless as to the system that's running his life. Circumstances that he thinks are completely out of his control that are keeping him from getting laid, getting promoted, and succeeding at becoming an alpha male.

The thing is, everything is fixable with the right mindset. Neo's transformation from Mr. Anderson into The One is a symbol for our own transformation from betas to alphas. You notice how he goes from being a failure to running everything and getting some of that sweet pussy? That's you and me, trying to reach enlightenment.

And that's why we're redpillers. And to show how aware I am, I'm constantly honing my technique by looking for better fedoras, negging women in Walmart parking lots, and making sure that I have unquestionably reached the pinnacle of employment at Circle K.

Good luck on your journey.",-1

**Sigma:** Like an alpha, but edgy and a loner. Or something.

**Lambda:** Homosexuals.

**Delta:** Beta betas, basically. So beta. Not involved in sexual marketplace.

**Gamma:** Respectable weirdos who do shit like science and art rather than singlemindedly pursue pussy every day.

**Omega:** Total fucking losers who jerk off to MLP. Obviously not involved in sexual marketplace.

Real terms, brah.

"Watch all the Rocky movies.  Train like Rocky, but with a more manly twist.  Punch live cows instead of a side of beef.  Instead of raw eggs in a glass.  Suck them right out of the chicken.  Male chickens work best as there is more testosterone.  It will help you train harder.    Don't skip rope.  That is girly.   Also, do not be like Rocky, only train like him.  Rocky was a slave to a female which makes him more beta than her.   Micky was right, Rocky was a bum and a tomato can!!!",-1

">Recently, one of my ""plates"" that I've been ""spinning"" told me she ""wasn't feeling good"" about ""herself"" or some shit.

This is a good thing!  Your alpha-ness has her hamster running full throttle 24/7, and her hamster is getting tired.  When hamsters get tired, their feeble female brains shut down and get full of hamster poo, which causes them to feel like shit.  Biotruths, bro.

If you want to go super saiyan 4 alpha, don't even talk to her at all, just show up and fuck her at your leisure.  But if you're not at that level yet, and if her mood is *really* starting to get on your nerves, change out her hamster's bedding.  And go down to your local Petsmart and get her hamster some more food (with her beta's money, obviously), just to be on the safe side.

>Set her up with a beta boyfriend who will pay for her to do stupid shit while she secretly bears my children?

No need, literally every woman already does this.  Literally *every single one ever*.  If she doesn't already have a beta provider for you to help her cheat on, she's post-wall or less than an HB10. in which case RUN BEFORE YOUR SMV PLUMMETS.",-1
